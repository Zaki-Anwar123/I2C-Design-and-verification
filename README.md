# I2C-Design-and-verification
The file conatins design and verification i2c .
This project implements an I²C memory model in SystemVerilog along with a UVM-based verification environment.
The design supports read, write, and reset operations using standard I²C protocol signaling.
The UVM testbench includes driver, monitor, scoreboard, and sequences to verify functionality with randomized transactions
